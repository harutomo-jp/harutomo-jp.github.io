# Thank you for visiting my site!

My name is Michael Sherlock, also known as Harutomo on a bunch of websites, and I am an etchical hacker, software developer, and lover of all things digital.  I enjoy participating in CTF tournaments but do not belong to an active team at this moment (if you're looking for a player reach out mjsherlock1999@gmail.com).

This website is essentially a collection of my research, program development, and note-taking from my time developing and practicing my skills in development and hacking.
